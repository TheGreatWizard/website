The first thing is to install the software [cjio](https://github.com/tudelft3d/cjio), which is used to manipulate, edit, and validate CityJSON files:

You must have Python (version >3.5) installed, and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).
To install the latest release:
```
pip install cjio
```

Download the demo file, you can open and browse that file in any text editor
