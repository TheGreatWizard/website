We envision CityJSON being used, exchanged, manipulated, and viewed on the web.
Therefore we would like to offer a [RESTful access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) to CityJSON datasets and offer the possibilities for datasets to be "streamed".

The modifications would not be part of the specifications (at this moment), and we plan to release our efforts as a "best practice" document.

We have made a proposal, feel free to comment on it:

It comes with a small [demo](http://hugoledoux.pythonanywhere.com/).
