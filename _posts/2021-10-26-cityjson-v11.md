We're happy to announce that CityJSON v1.1 is now released 🎉🍾🚀

The update brings the following:

  - small fixes that annoyed developers
  - very large CityJSON can be streamed efficiently with the new `CityJSONFeature` type
  - CityJSON is the first encoding to be [compliant with CityGML v3.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/conformance/v30/)

Perhaps more importantly, we have updated the eco-systems:

  - [cjio](https://github.com/cityjson/cjio) has been updated to v0.7 and offers an upgrade operator to automatically upgrade your existing files
  - CityJSON has a [new validator](https://validator.cityjson.org/) and it is by our rough estimates 68129X times faster ([written in Rust](https://github.com/cityjson/cjval))
  - you can upgrade your files automatically and pain-free


If you are a developer, you can see [on this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev/upgrade11/) what you need to do to update your code to be ready for v1.1 files.
Most changes are small, and we expect this upgrade to take a maximum of a few hours.
