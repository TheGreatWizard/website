Today we're happy to launch the version 1.0.0 of CityJSON!

It took us less than 2 years ([first commit](https://github.com/tudelft3d/cityjson/commit/affadcfcc44002b70d18ea023679fde39b8b111e) was 19 June 2017) to build a JSON-encoding of the CityGML data model 2.0.0.

It comes with several software packages, full open specifications, and all existing CityGML datasets can be converted in one-click to CityJSON (we call this "The Liberator" ðŸ˜¬).

While CityJSON is mostly made and maintained by the [3D Geoinformation group at the TU Delft](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl), everyone is welcome to [contribute by submitting new content and/or fixing errors]({{ "/contribute/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
