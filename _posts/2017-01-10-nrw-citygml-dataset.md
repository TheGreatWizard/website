We are very happy to see that North Rhine-Westphalia has released as open their 3D city model.
It covers a gigantic region, and both LoD1 and LoD2 models of the buildings are present.
Buildings are stored both with `gml:Solid` `gml:MultiSurface`, and the semantics is present, which is üëç.
Our only concern is that the files are CityGML v1.0, while v2.0 has been out since 2012; but we will forgive them this oversight.

[Download here the CityGML files](https://www.opengeodata.nrw.de/produkte/geobasis/3d-gm/), but watch out, it's enormous: more than 286GB of zipped GML!
