We've been working hard, in collaboration with [Geonovum](https://www.geonovum.nl/), on improving CityJSON and we're happy today to release version 1.1 üéâüçæüöÄ

## The update brings the following:

  - small fixes that annoyed developers ([full list of changes]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev/upgrade11/))
  - very large CityJSON can be streamed efficiently with the new `CityJSONFeature` type
  - CityJSON is the first encoding to be [conformant with the OGC CityGML v3.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/conformance/v30/)


## The full specifications

[CityJSON v1.1.0 specifications]({{ site.baseurl }}/specs/1.1.0/)


## Software 

Perhaps more importantly, we have updated the eco-systems:

  - [cjio](https://github.com/cityjson/cjio) has been updated to v0.7 and offers an upgrade operator to automatically upgrade your existing files
  - CityJSON has a [new validator](https://validator.cityjson.org/) and it is by our rough estimates 68129X times faster (written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org))
  - you can [upgrade your files automatically and pain-free]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/upgrade11/)
  - [the online view ninja](https://ninja.cityjson.org/) supports v1.1 already 

Other software like [azul](https://github.com/tudelft3d/azul), [FME](https://github.com/safesoftware/fme-CityJSON/), and [citygml4j](https://github.com/citygml4j/citygml-tools) will be updated soon.

## Developer?

If you are a developer, you can see [on this page]({{ site.baseurl }}/dev/upgrade11/) what you need to do to update your code to be ready for v1.1 files.
Most changes are small, and we expect this upgrade to take a maximum of a few hours.
