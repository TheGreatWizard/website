An open 3D city model of all public housing (HDB) buildings in Singapore is now available with accompanying open source code for how the model was generated. The [Urban Analytics Lab](https://ual.sg/) at the National University of Singapore generated the model with two datasets, [2D building footprints from OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/1.3649/103.8229) and [HDB Property Information](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/hdb-property-information).

[Data](https://github.com/ualsg/hdb3d-data) and [code](https://github.com/ualsg/hdb3d-code) both available on GitHub and an accompanying [blog post](https://ual.sg/post/2019/08/25/release-of-3d-building-open-data-of-hdbs-in-singapore/) has further information.
