The "offical" web-viewer ([viewer.cityjson.org](https://viewer.cityjson.org/)) has been greatly improved by [Felix Dahle](https://github.com/fdahle) for the course [Research Assignment](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/geo5010/) in the [Msc Geomatics at Delft University of Technology](https://geomatics.tudelft.nl).

The improvements:

  - get attribute information of city objects
  - load multiple files at the same time
  - supporting of parent/children
  - hide/show complete file or single objects
  - shadow support for presentation
  - smoother controls
