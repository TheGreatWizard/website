A Blender plugin has just been released, it allows us to import all CityJSON objects, and building attributes and semantic surfaces are stored and can be accesed via Blender's layout.

[Download the plugin on the GitHub page](https://github.com/cityjson/Blender-CityJSON-Plugin), and you can contribute too since the source is open.
