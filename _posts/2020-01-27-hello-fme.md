We're happy to announce that [Safe FME](https://www.safe.com/fme/) has now CityJSON support.
The reader and the writer are in beta (Technical Preview), but they are usable and almost everything is supported (except metadata and appearances).
The support is collaboration between the [3D geoinformation group at TUDelft](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl), [Safe](https://www.safe.com), and [Geonovum](https://www.geonovum.nl).

To use it, either:

  - [download the latest 2020 beta of FME](https://www.safe.com/support/downloads/#beta)
  - [download the reader/writer on the GitHub page](https://github.com/safesoftware/fme-CityJSON), compile it (it's explained), and install it. It's not very complex.

Notice that the code is open-source and will stay so in the future.

You can help by adding features or testing it and reporting bugs/problems on [the GitHub issues page](https://github.com/safesoftware/fme-CityJSON/issues).
